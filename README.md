# Think of this as an app to track any events in your life, ordering them in chronological order
# You need to enter a name for the event, a location(even if there is not one in specific), a start and end time
# The start and end time include dates as an event could span across multiple days 
# After saving an event, you can edit and delete. 
# If you add an event where the end time is before the start, you get an error.
